        pizza so unique? Let‚Äôs explore the history, ingredients, and methods
        that define real Italian pizza.

        The Origins of Italian Pizza
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Pizza, as we know it today, originated in Naples, Italy, during the 18th
        century. The famous Margherita Pizza was first made in 1889 when a
        Neapolitan pizza maker, Raffaele Esposito, created a dish in honor of
        Queen Margherita. He used simple yet flavorful ingredients: tomato,
        mozzarella, and fresh basil, which represented the colors of the Italian
        flag.

          elastic dough for a perfect thin crust.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>San Marzano Tomatoes:</strong> Grown in volcanic soil, these
          tomatoes provide the best flavor for authentic pizza sauce.

        The Traditional Cooking Method
      </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        True Italian pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven at temperatures
        exceeding 450¬∞C (850¬∞F). This quick cooking method‚Äîoften under 90
        seconds‚Äîcreates a crispy, slightly charred crust while keeping the
        inside soft and airy.
